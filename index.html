				<h2>Font Bureau OpenType 1.8 Variations Axes Proposals</h2>
				
				<p>This guide has been prepared for presentation to the public, the specification's owners, and the OpenType Variations working group in July, 2017. Our goal is to record what we have learned and applied about Variation fonts that we believe are generally useful to the specification.</p>
				<p>The proposal does not seek to classify the designs of typefaces parametrically, only what the values of the parameters are. And, this proposal is offered as a beginning, suggesting the need for, but not containing proposal for many important attributes of non-Latin fonts. </p>
				<p>The registration of the axes here, is also intended to be used as part of a system including the registration of what function an axis performs for programs and/or users along the existing path from script selection to the rendered glyph in a document, aka the Mantra. Documentation of that part of the system, including the registration of what function an axis provides, is in development and will follow.</p>

				<h3>A. Primary Type Axes</h3>
				<p>Type users are familiar with the attributes of a typeface family that combine to make its appearance. It has been customary for these attributes to be available as named and instantiated styles in font families. Some of these attributes are already recorded in fonts conforming to the OpenType v1.0 specification, as values in the OS/2 table, and in other tables of the SFNT format in general.</p>
				<p>Today's font families contain instances pertaining to attributes of registered axes of Opentype, like width, weight and optical size. In addition, some existing font families contain instances pertaining to grades, descender length, multi-script font mixing for different vertical proportions, and font families contain instances made for specific output, or with specific data to suite particular platform requirements. </p>
				<p>This proposal is for new and more complete set of typographic axes, with a unified value system, concern for non-Latin, responsive typography, compression and more. The registration of a full set of attributes allows type developers to combine the modern, potentially much larger font family, into a single file, software developers and educators to have a clearer picture of how typography forms from the basic attributes, and type users to control the attributes more precisely, whether that control is programmatic or via UI.</p>

				<h3>B. Treatment Axes</h3>
				<p>Many treatments of typography, outlining or underlining, as well as drop shadows and more, are currently available to users via page description languages and applications, where only a uniform, size-independent transformation of all the glyphs of an instance is the result. </p>
				<p>Knowing that fonts usually provide a better solution to smearing regular type for "bold", oblique-ing it for "italic", and that optical size, the most common treatment of all, is a registered axis, variation axes can provide these and other treatments better than applications, give users more precise control per treatment, and per glyph, while also providing information to applications that these axes exist, and what their value systems are, releiving apps from having to provide the treatment, should the user desire to do so, with the font providing the means.</p>

				<h3>C. Non-Latin Axes</h3>
				<p>Today's multi-script type designer faces two major options when mixing more than one script in a typeface family; to compromise one or compromise both scripts to the ideals of the other, (that's one thing;). Or to make multiple instances of the font to provide un-compromised versions of each. </p>
				<p>The compromises occur in all of the typographic parameters listed in A above, and surface in the choices that need to be made in presenting a unified appearance of width, weight and height among glyphs of different scripts. These compromises come in a variety of sizes from small, as when Latin and Cyrillic need to work together, to large, as when Chinese and Arabic have to work together. And of course there are the super-sized compromises in OS fonts, where the typeface family contains 53 scripts.</p>
				<p>In these scenarios, the type developer is challenged to come up with a single harmonious solution, per size, to the weights and widths of each glyph, to form the correct relationship between transparent and opaque across all the glyphs of the scripts involved. And if the user does not like the type designer's solutions, they are free to roam the width and weight axes and programmatically, or manually redefine the inter-script solutions to weight and width. It is important to understand that this option is open to the type developer and user without script-specific opaque and transparent attributes, because the proper weight and width per style are solvable in the hands of developers and users without registered weight axes for every script.</p>
				<p>Alignments operate differently in typography. So in variable fonts they must be able to operate independently of each other at any given weight, width and size, ahead of whatever decisions occur in those attributes. Up until now, all the scripts of Unicode have shared what could be read as Latin alignments in the Opentype spec. </p>
				<p>This proposal does not prevent type developers from continuing to share one set of registered alignments among all the scripts of Unicode. What it suggests is that if variable font developers want to maintain compression, performance and quality in multi script design, that registered axes for the alignments specific to each script are required. And Chinese alignment values that are definable independent of Latin alignment values is a good place to start.</p>

				<h3>D. Motion Axes</h3>
				<p>The essence of designing realistic motion in media with Variations requires giving users and programs a simple solution to the equation: Distance = Rate × Time. The proposed axes enable type developers to define the distances their animation move per cycle of animation, so motion graphics designers can solve this equation relative to size of use without trial-and-error on each glyph.</p>
				<p>As Variations will undoubtably be put to the task of Variations, these axes create a common meeting point between design and use of functionality.</p>

				<h3>E. Glyph Axes</h3>
				<p>The existing opentype specification allows composites, i.e, reference from a glyph to use another glyph, possibly repositioned or otherwise transformed, to save space and time in the development of fonts using the same shape repeatedly. </p>
				<p>In tradition type founding, a font developer would not hesitate to create fractions using a glyph from a smaller size master of the same style, In Variations, using the same contours of a glyph repeatedly, with deltas for weight, width and optical size, opens up the possibility of using those and other instances for many such purposes, but only if the developer can pinpoint the instance location particular glyphs, or glyphs of a particular feature, along a registered axis.</p>

				<b>Scale interpretation:</b> Values can be interpreted as per-mille-of-em<br>
				<b>Recommended ‘normal’ value:</b> none<br>
				<b>Suggested programmatic interactions:</b> Applications may enable plotting the number of loops of an animation required for the time and distance defined by the user<br>
				<b>Suggested user interactions:</b> Users may choose different speeds and distances traveled by an animation<br>
				<b>Related axis information:</b> Users may choose different speeds and distances traveled by an animation<br>

				<b>Tag:</b> rsec<br>
				<b>Name:</b> relative second<br>
				<b>Description:</b> axis contains a relative second value for one, or each glyph on that axis<br>
				<b>Valid numeric range:</b> 001- 60.00<br>
				<b>Scale interpretation:</b> Value can be interpreted as a recommendation for one second of animation time<br>
				<b>Recommended ‘normal’ value:</b> 1<br>
				<b>Suggested programmatic interactions:</b> Applications may plot the relative time of a glyph, or a glyph to other glyphs, and play them in relative or absolute time<br>
				<b>Suggested user interactions:</b> Users may choose realistic, or other speeds for an animation<br>
				<b>Related axis information:</b> Users may choose realistic, or other speeds for an animation<br>

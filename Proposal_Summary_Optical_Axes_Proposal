# Proposal: Optical Axes Proposal

## Administrative Information
**Proposers name:** Sam Berlow

**Vendor affiliation:** Type Network

**Proposal name:** Parametric Axes

**Date of submission:** 12/11/2017

**New or revised proposal:** New

**Previous revision date:** N/A

## General Technical Information

**Overview**
Text tktk

**Related axes:** XTRA, YTRA, XOPQ, YOPQ, YTUC, YTLC, YTDE, YTAS, PWTH, PWGT

**Similar axes:** wght and wdth

**Axis type:** Optical

## Proposed Axis Details: `pwth`

**Tag:** pwth

**Name:** Width (Parametric)

**Axis type:** Optical

**Description:** Used to vary width of text from narrower to wider; may be constructed by blending other primary axes, or via referenced instances of other
axes

**Valid numeric range:**  0 to 2000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may easily compute the appropriate weight to get a specific stem thickness.

**UI recommendations:** Primarily through end-user interfaces

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts

**Related axes:** Always: xtra xopq. Sometimes: yopq ytos ytus

**Similar axes:** wdth

**Additional information:** This value range starts at 0 because if width is zero, counterforms are all closed in; if the XTRA value is negative, that doesn't matter in the blended axes. 

## Justification

**Vendor commitments:** Google Fonts, Font Bureau, TYPETR

**Conventionality benefits:** A secondary benefit is that it encourages people to reason about their typography in per-mille measurements, a conventionality benefit. 

**Interoperability benefits:** The primary benefit of this axis is that is makes optical width more consistent, compared to the existing wght axis, and this is especially important when switching between families – thus an interop benefit. 

## Proposed Axis Details: `pwht`

**Tag:** pwht

**Name:** Weight (Parametric)

**Axis type:** Optical

**Description:** Used to vary stroke thicknesses or other design details to give variation from lighter to blacker; may be constructed by blending other primary axes, or via referenced instances of other
axes

**Valid numeric range:**  1 to 2000

**Scale interpretation:** Values should be interpreted as per-mille-of-em

**Recommended or required “Regular” value:** N/A

**Suggested programmatic interactions:** Example: Program or script may easily compute the appropriate weight to get a specific stem thickness.

**UI recommendations:** Primarily through end-user interfaces

**Script or language considerations:** Can be used for all scripts

**Related axes:** Always: xtra xopq. Sometime: yopq ytlc ytos (y overshoot at x height or above) ytus (y undershoot at baseline or below)

**Similar axes:** wght

**Additional information:** This value range starts at 1 because if it was zero, no ink would be drawn.

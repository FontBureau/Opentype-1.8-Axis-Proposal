## How This Site Is Made

This site is constructed with Jeykll, and hosted on [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com) so that your Pull Requests, when merged, will quickly become the live site without further action.

To install the command line tools and run a local server for development, run:

    sudo gem install bundler
    bundle install
    jekyll serve

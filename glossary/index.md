<dl>

<dt id='ascender'>Ascender</dt>
<dd>The part of a lowercase letter that extends above the typeface’s x-height.</dd>

<dt id='bracket'>Bracket</dt>
<dd>In a serif typeface, the connection between a serif and the main stroke. The bracket
may be a curve, a slope, or any combination or variation of these. Unbracketed serifs
meet the main stroke at a sharp angle.</dd>

<dt id='characterwidth'>Character width</dt>
<dd>Horizontal space taken up by the character, including the built-in white space
(sidebearings) on either side.</dd>

<dt id='contrast'>Contrast</dt>
<dd>Degree of variation of thickness between thick strokes and thin strokes of a character.
High-contrast typefaces have greater variation in stroke thickness than low-contrast
typefaces.</dd>

<dt id='descender'>Descender</dt>
<dd>The part of a lowercase letter that extends below the typeface’s baseline.</dd>

<dt id='joint'>Joint</dt>
<dd>In a character, where one stroke meets another.</dd>

<dt id='kerning'>Kerning</dt>
<dd>Adjustment of horizontal space between two characters.</dd>

<dt id='inktrap'>Ink trap</dt>
<dd>Exaggerated wedge of white space where strokes of a letter join at an angle, to avoid
the appearance at small sizes of the angle filling in (originally, literally filling with ink).</dd>

<dt id='leading'>Leading</dt>
<dd>Vertical space between two lines of type; usually measured from the baseline of one
line to the baseline of the next.</dd>

<dt id='letterspacing'>Letter spacing</dt>
<dd>The overall horizontal space between characters.</dd>

<dt id='monospace'>Monospace</dt>
<dd>All the same width. In a monospaced font, each of the characters occupies the same
amount of horizontal space.</dd>

<dt id='opaque'>Opaque</dt>
<dd>Solid; not able to be seen through; not transparent. In digital fonts, blocking any
object behind it. This is also often referred to as “black,” “color,” or “foreground.”</dd>

<dt id='opticalsize'>Optical size</dt>
<dd>Subtle adjustments to a typeface’s design parameters for use at different sizes. Often
including larger x-height, wider characters, looser letter spacing, and lower contrast at
small sizes, versus tighter letter spacing and higher contrasts, along with a smaller xheight,
and narrower character widths, in many designs at large sizes.</dd>

<dt id='proportional'>Proportional</dt>
<dd>Widths varying with the character shape. In a proportional font, different
characters occupy different amounts of horizontal space.</dd>

<dt id='serif'>Serif</dt>
<dd>Short cross-stroke, or part of one, at the end of stroke in a character. May be angled
or perpen<dd>dicular, and may be bracketed or unbracketed.</dd>

<dt id='stem'>Stem</dt>
<dd>Main vertical stroke of a character.</dd>

<dt id='tracking'>Tracking</dt>
<dd>Adjustment of horizontal space consistently across a range of characters.</dd>

<dt id='transparent'>Transparent</dt>
<dd>Allowing light to pass through so that objects behind can be distinctly seen. In digital
fonts, not blocking any object behind it. This is also often referred to as “white,”
“spacing,” or “background.”</dd>

<dt id='weight'>Weight</dt>
<dd>The proportion of black to white within the characters in a font. The overall effect of
the typeface: light, medium, bold, heavy, etc. A parameter that can be varied along
the weight axis of a variable font. Weight may be added by increasing the thickness of
only the thick strokes, or of all the strokes in a character depending on design class.</dd>

<dt id='width'>Width</dt>
<dd>The proportion of horizontal to vertical space taken up by the characters in a font. The
overall effect of the typeface: narrow, wide, condensed, expanded, etc. A parameter
that can be varied along the width axis of a variable font.</dd>

<dt id='xheight'>x-height</dt>
<dd>Vertical distance between the baseline and the top of the body of a lowercase letter.
Called "x-height" because in most typefaces, the top of the <b>x</b> is flat and easy to
measure; rounded letters like <b>o</b> normally have a slight overshoot. The x-height can be
a factor in a font’s optical size.</dd>
